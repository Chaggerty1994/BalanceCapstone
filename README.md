# Balance

Balance is a time management application that helps its users organize their lives. Offering a user-friendly interface to keep track of personal and team oriented goals with customizable lists, and regiment their point of focus throughout the day with a pomodoro timer.

# Inspiration

My inspiration for this project was very personal. I was Diagnosed with ADHD last year and realized I had been living untreated for my whole life. I have been pretty high functioning as an adult but I want more consistancy, stability, predicatablilty, and punctuality. I want to be in charge of my focus not the other way around. I decided that a big part of my treatment was going to be cognitive behavioral therapy. The first thing I implemented was a to-do list and a pomodoro timer. They really helped me so much with my studying and project concentration. But I was frustrated by having to have both of them in seperate windows clicking back and forth all day, and I couldnt find one online that had both. So I built One! It was an awesome first full project to get to design and build, and it felt very important and personal. I still use my app daily!  

# Development

This project was created for my Front End Capstone project at Nashville Software School. 

My main Objectives in building Balance were 

- Use React to build a CRUD application
- Style the application using Material UI

I wanted the application to be visually appealing, minimalist, and useful.
