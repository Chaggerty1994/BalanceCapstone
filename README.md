# Balance

Balance is a time management application that helps its users organize their lives. Offering a user-friendly interface to keep track of personal and team oriented goals with customizable lists, and regiment their point of focus throughout the day with a pomodoro timer.

     How it works
----------------------------------------------------------------

Users must register to create a profile using their name and email address. The email address is not used by the site for anything besides log in so you can make one up if youd like.

Once you have logged in, you will be directed to the home page of the application where you will see a pomodoro timer with a dropdown menu to the right, and an empty to do list with a form for new to-do's to the left. 

When adding a task to your to do list you may add the text, specify a time incriment you would like to focus on the task for, say if it is a personal or a group task, and submit it. 

When the task posts to the list it will be purple if it is personal or light - blue if it is a group task. If you specify a task to be a group task it will appear in other users list. 

You can edit the text of a posted task, trigger the associated timer settings, change the privacy from personal to group and vice versa, as well as delete the task.

The pomodoro timer has A and B settings buttons for work and rest mode, a start and stop button and a dropdown menu to change the timer incriments. Any time you change the timer settings you must hit the A button to reset the timer.

There is a My Account page where you can view and edit your personal account information.


    The Development
--------------------------------------------

This project was created for my Front End Capstone project at Nashville Software School. 

My main Objectives in building Balance were 

- Use React to build a CRUD application
- Style the application using Material UI

I wanted the application to be visually appealing, minimalist, and useful.

    How to install and run this application
-------------------------------------------
If you would like to use this application you can use the [live site](https://balance-capstone-tis8s.ondigitalocean.app/login)

If you want to play around with the code, follow the instructions below

- Clone this repository
- Make a secondary directory for the database like [this one](https://github.com/Chaggerty1994/capstone-api)
- This repo is for the live site so you must replace remoteURL with **"localhost:8088"**
- In the database directory run **json-server database.json -p 8088 -w**
- Open another terminal window and navigate the the project directory
- In the project directory run **npm start**
- In a browser, open localhost:3000 and you should see the app running.
